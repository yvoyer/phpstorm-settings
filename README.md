This is my custom configuration for PHPStorm, so that all my environments are setup the same.

Feel free to fork, to add your own settings.

Install
=======

* Clone the project: `git clone http://github.com/yvoyer/phpstorm-settings`
* Execute the `./compile-settings.sh`: It will generate a `settings.jar` file with the configured settings
* Import the generated settings in your PHPStorm (**File->Import Settings...**), by selecting the `settings.jar` at the root of the project.

**Optional**: You might want to put your Author information in the `fileTemplates/includes/Author.php`, so that your files contains your information.
